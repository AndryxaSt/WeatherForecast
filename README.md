# WeatherForecast
This project was created to get weather from several servers, average the results and return the forecast for a day, 3 days, a week and 16 days.

New solutions were developed for receiving and parsing weather from remote servers, but in a separate case, a ready-made one was used.
The weather comparison and averaging logic was developed from scratch.
